This describe the current state of my home infrastructure.
I'll go through a short description of my machines first and then with an overview, and finally with a list of all services I host.

In this page, I'll reference a few blog post related, to specific services or setup.

NB: If you want an history of the infrastructure take a look to the git repository and changes of this file over time.


== Overview

So we have 3 machines each one is dedicated to a special task.

- NAS -> Store data, and host a few services
- HTPC -> Host services related to Streaming (audio and video) because it has a graphical card
- Proxy -> Only serves the reverse proxy role, and DNS/ DHCP (Inner-edge services)

All of the services I host are deployed using docker. 
All the machines uses docker swarm to facilitate the deployement ( Host is declared in a file and can be easily versionned)

== My babies

=== PiProxy

For the proxy purposed I invested in a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. 
The RPI4 has the advantage to be small, having a great network interface and has quite good performances. 
I think it is easy to set them up as a cluster in case I want to upgrade them.

==== Hardware
// TODO Add rpi4 specs

RAM: 4GB
Ethernet: 1Gb (That's why I uses it as proxy)

==== Services

=== NASGull

My very first build, I'm proud of it. It made me learn a lot about hardware, specs, and how everything work together. 
As first build it was not bad but if I look back I think I should have done few things differently. 
That's why it will be changed a bit in weeks to come.

This machine as you might have guessed, serve the NAS purpose. 

.The rules are
* A lot of disks
* A great Network Interface (Would have prefered to have two, but my network is not that large for the moment) 

==== Hardware

Processor: Intel Pentium Gold
Motherboard: MSI Mini ITX
PSU: 450W Platinium Seasonic 
CG: None
RAM: 16GB
Additionnal PCIE: 2 * 2 SATA port card 
HDD: 8 * 4TB Western Digital RED + 1 * 1TB Seagate Barracuda.
SSD: 100GB WD blue.
Case: Actually Fractal Design R5 White that is a bit massive. So I'm waiting for the delivery of a Node804 case.

==== Software

OS: FreeNAS
1 CentOS VM for docker services.

.Running Services
* NFS
* SMART Drive tests
* Two ZFS array (RAID 10 equivalent.) so 12TB usable.

I plan to move to TrueNAS Core when out, it should allow me to remove the CentOS VM which I don't really need.

=== HTPC

image::/img/about/infrastructure/HTPC.jpg[300,300]

An old ASUS laptop, that I once used and is now too old to be used as a laptop. 
The battery is melting, and needs to be plugged in almost all the time.
So I made an HTPC out of him and it works pretty great (It used to be my NAS with several bay connected with USB.) Cheap and working.

The only customization I made was to remove the screen. Leaving the keyboard and eventually plug him in on a screen.
A thing I hated with this laptop, was that I could'nt get any boot screen.
So to perform the installation I had to remove the HDD and install the OS from another computer.

==== Hardware

Processor: Intel Core i7 
RAM: 2* 8GB
CG: Nvidia 730M
HDD: 1TB
Ethenet: 1GB (but actually uses 100M don't really know why.... Need to investigate.)

OS : Ubuntu 18.04
Docker

.Basics : (Stands to be really simple to achieve a single purpose and getting started)
* Setup NFS service on your NAS and connect from another computer.
* Deploy a service to your local network
* Deploy a service to the internet

.Advanced :
* Setup your Installation using Ansible 
* Use docker for deployement
* Monitor your services

.MISC : (Somethings I was hit by when selfhosting, or useful tips)
* Orange (french internet provider) DNS issues for accessing local services with external address
