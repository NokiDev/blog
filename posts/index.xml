      <description>Traefik is a modern reverse proxy that integrates with container technologies and related orchestrators. In our case we&amp;#8217;re going to use it&amp;#8217;s docker integration. Traefik uses docker socket to retrieve information about running containers, and labels that are attached to it. (if you use docker inspect you would get the idea.)

 Disclaimer: This article does not attend to secure your services it is pretty basic setup to start with traefik, if you want to secure your services head to this article</description>
