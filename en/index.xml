      <description>Traefik is a modern reverse proxy that integrates with container technologies and related orchestrators. In our case we&amp;#8217;re going to use it&amp;#8217;s docker integration. Traefik uses docker socket to retrieve information about running containers, and labels that are attached to it. (if you use docker inspect you would get the idea.)
 This article requires that you are already familiar with container thechnology and especially docker.
 Disclaimer: This article is not meant to secure your services, it is a pretty basic setup to start with traefik, if you want to secure your services head to the next article of this series</description>

      <description>When setting up my homelab, I encountered a pretty weird issue related to my Internet Provider Router box.
 Using the same address for accessing my website on local network and external network. This is to simplify and configure services with external http addresses rather than local one. Because external ones probably wont change that much over time. And if I use a laptop both in and out I prefer my bookmarks to remain the same</description>

      <description>Hello 
 I am a french developper, living in France too. I&amp;#8217;m currently working in the medical industry as C++ Software Engineer, and more recently working on CI/CD, and server administration trying to instaurate the DevOps culture in my company.
 I&amp;#8217;m really passionate about computer science and all the domains that cross it. Like CyberSecurity, Server administration, software developement, a bit of hardware and IOTs (but I&amp;#8217;m really bad at it).</description>
