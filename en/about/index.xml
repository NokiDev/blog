      <description>Hello 
 I am a french developper, living in France too. I&amp;#8217;m currently working in the medical industry as C++ Software Engineer, and more recently working on CI/CD, and server administration trying to instaurate the DevOps culture in my company.
 I&amp;#8217;m really passionate about computer science and all the domains that cross it. Like CyberSecurity, Server administration, software developement, a bit of hardware and IOTs (but I&amp;#8217;m really bad at it).</description>
